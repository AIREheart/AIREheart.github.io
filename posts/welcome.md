## A Space for Synthesis

This site exists at the intersection of several worlds I inhabit: the wet lab, the command line, the philosophical text, the natural world. Like a lake at midnight, it reflects what surrounds it while maintaining its own depths.

## Why Chronicle?

The word "chronicle" carries weight. It suggests not just recording, but curating—choosing what deserves remembrance. As I navigate the transition from biochemist to computational biologist, I want to capture:

- **Technical learnings**: The algorithms that finally clicked, the bugs that taught humility
- **Philosophical musings**: What does it mean to model life? When is abstraction useful vs. reductive?
- **The process**: Not just successes, but the meandering path between confusion and clarity

## The Aesthetic

You'll notice the midnight blues, the subtle movement, the literary touches. These aren't mere decoration—they reflect my belief that technical work benefits from beauty, that code can be poetic, that science and art enhance rather than oppose each other.

The swan gliding across this digital lake isn't random. Swans appear serene on the surface while paddling furiously beneath—a fitting metaphor for the computational biologist's work.

## What's Coming

Expect posts on:
- ML models for protein structure
- Bioinformatics pipeline design
- Reflections on career pivots
- Book notes (heavy on philosophy, science, literature)
- Occasional technical tutorials

This is a living space, meant to grow and change. Welcome.
