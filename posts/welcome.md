excerpt: "This site exists at the intersection of several worlds I inhabit: the wet lab, the command line, the philosophical text, the natural world."

## A Space for Synthesis

Like a lake at midnight, this space reflects what surrounds it while maintaining its own depths. It exists at the convergence of disciplines I've inhabited—each informing the others in unexpected ways.

The wet lab taught me patience and precision. The command line taught me elegance in abstraction. Philosophy taught me to question assumptions. Nature taught me that complexity emerges from simple rules, beautifully executed.

## Why Chronicle?

The word "chronicle" carries weight. It suggests not just recording, but **curating**—choosing what deserves remembrance. As I navigate the transition from biochemist to computational biologist, I want to capture:

- **Technical learnings**: The algorithms that finally clicked, the bugs that taught humility
- **Philosophical musings**: What does it mean to model life? When is abstraction useful vs. reductive?
- **The process**: Not just successes, but the meandering path between confusion and clarity

This isn't a polished portfolio of accomplishments. It's a working notebook, made public in the spirit of learning in the open.

## The Aesthetic

You'll notice the midnight blues, the subtle movement, the literary touches. These aren't mere decoration—they reflect my belief that technical work benefits from beauty, that code can be poetic, that science and art enhance rather than oppose each other.

The swan gliding across this digital lake isn't random. Swans appear serene on the surface while paddling furiously beneath—a fitting metaphor for the computational biologist's work.

### On Visual Metaphors

I've always been drawn to the liminal—spaces where boundaries blur:

- **Dawn and dusk** over stark noon
- **Coastlines** over landlocked spaces  
- **Interdisciplinary work** over siloed expertise

The midnight lakeside captures this. It's neither day nor night, neither land nor water. It's a space of transformation.

## What's Coming

Expect posts on:

1. **ML models for protein structure** - Deep dives into architectures, training strategies, and biological constraints
2. **Bioinformatics pipeline design** - Lessons from production systems, reproducibility, and handling messy real-world data
3. **Career pivots** - The awkward middle ground between domains, imposter syndrome, and finding your niche
4. **Book notes** - Heavy on philosophy of science, biology, and literature that shapes how I think
5. **Technical tutorials** - Concepts I wish someone had explained to me clearly

Some posts will be long-form explorations. Others will be brief observations. All will be honest about both breakthroughs and blind alleys.

This quote resonates because it captures something essential about research: you start with a question, but the process itself teaches you things you didn't know to ask.

## The Living Document

This is a **living space**, meant to grow and change. Posts may be updated as I learn more. Links will multiply. Structure will evolve. The site itself is an experiment in computational biology—observing how ideas interact, compete, and synthesize.

If you're reading this, you're witnessing the beginning. Whether you stumbled here via search, followed a link, or are a future version of me revisiting these early thoughts—welcome.

The water is still. The moon is bright. Let's see what surfaces.
